The objectives are:

    - product features & product documentation up to date
    - usability & user experience
    - performance
    - security
    - ...
    
Procedures for quality code production are:

    - run sonar locally and fix all high issues before commiting on the trunk
    - ...

Procedures (or phases) for quality product validation and verification:

    - requirements are checked three times to ensure proper comprehension before implementation begins
    - unit, integration tests checks that the code does what he was written for
    - acceptance tests checks that the right software has been built
    - release is performed when the done criteria is met (see: Done criteria section)
    - ...
    
Achievement of the quality objectives:

    - reduces bugs found in production (Starting with 100 in September 2011)
    - more bugs found before going in production (avg of 1 per iteration in September 2011)
